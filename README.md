# UI-UX Learning

Personal project to improve my frontend skills.
The goal is to create a webapp which strictly follows material design guidelines.

Old versions will be stored in other branches so I can keep track of templates/progress.

## Technologies

- Nuxt js
- Typescript
- Vuetify
- Nuxt Axios
- Nuxt Auth Module
- Vue Wait

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
